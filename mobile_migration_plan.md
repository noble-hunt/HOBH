- JWT authentication
- Rate limiting and caching
- API versioning
- Swagger documentation

### Required Endpoints:
```
/api/v1/auth
  - POST /login
  - POST /register
  - POST /refresh-token
  - POST /logout

/api/v1/workouts
  - GET /list
  - POST /create
  - GET /{id}
  - PUT /{id}
  - DELETE /{id}

/api/v1/progress
  - GET /stats
  - GET /achievements
  - GET /history

/api/v1/social
  - GET /feed
  - POST /share
  - POST /like
  - POST /comment
```

### Data Migration:

- Setup database migrations
- Create data sync mechanism

## 3. App Store Compliance
### Requirements:
- Privacy Policy
- Terms of Service
- App Store description and screenshots
- Age rating documentation
- Export compliance
- Data handling documentation

### Technical Requirements:
- Support latest iOS version

- Screenshots for different devices
- App preview videos
- Keywords and descriptions
- Support URL and marketing materials

## 4. Mobile-Specific Features
### Offline Functionality:
- Local data storage using Core Data
- Offline data sync
- Conflict resolution
- Background data refresh

### Push Notifications:
- Configure APNS
- Implement notification categories
- Handle notification permissions

- Certificate pinning
- App state preservation

## Implementation Timeline
1. Week 1-2: Setup iOS development environment and project structure
2. Week 3-4: Basic UI implementation and navigation
3. Week 5-6: Core functionality migration
4. Week 7-8: API integration and offline support
5. Week 9-10: Mobile-specific features
6. Week 11-12: Testing and App Store preparation

## Required Resources
- iOS Developer Account
- Apple Developer Tools
- Testing Devices
- TestFlight Setup
- CI/CD Pipeline
- Analytics Integration

## Next Steps
1. Set up iOS development environment
2. Create initial Swift UI project structure
